# <Express.js-Note-Taker>

## Description

- My motivation for building this project was to create an application where the user can create, store, and delete notes to keep reminders in a centralized location
- I built this project because I am very forgetful and am always near my computer, so having my notes be stored in an app of my own creation was a good idea.
- Throughout this challenge I learned how to create an express server and route html and data so that it can be rendered on the server

## Installation
if visiting the deployed site, no installation is necessary. If cloning and running locally then in bash,

npm i
npm start

Clicking Get Started will bring you to this page where the magic happens. Enter a note title and description and then click the save button that will appear in the top right after a description is entered.

After clicking save, the note title will appear on the left side of the screen. Clicking on the new entry will bring it back into the title/description section where you can read the description once again.
